## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Job-Finder team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability?

To report a security issue, please send an email to giftmoobi@gmail.com with the following information:

1. A detailed description of the vulnerability.
2. Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
3. Potential impacts of the vulnerability.
4. Any suggestions for mitigating the vulnerability.

### What to Expect

After submitting a report, you should receive a response from us within 48 hours acknowledging receipt of your report. We will also communicate our evaluation of the issue and an expected resolution timeframe.

Please do the following to help us better understand the nature and scope of the reported issue:

- Provide as much information as possible to help us reproduce the issue.
- Avoid disclosing this issue publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

### Policy on Public Disclosure

We believe that public disclosure of vulnerabilities is an essential part of the vulnerability disclosure process, and that one of the best ways to make software better is to enable developers to learn from the findings of others.

However, we ask that you do not share your findings publicly until:

- A patch has been developed, and it is reasonable to assume that users have had enough time to apply the patch.
- The issue has been disclosed publicly by the Job-Finder team.

This policy ensures that Job-Finder users have time to deploy fixes before the vulnerability is publicly disclosed.
